Developing a Spring Boot Application Using Best Practices – Coaching Institute Management
Installation Guide
1. System Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 17 or higher.
Maven: Used to build and manage project dependencies.
IDE (Optional): Such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc., for development and debugging.
Database: Supported databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other compatible databases.
2. Installation Steps
1. Clone the Project Repository
If you haven't already downloaded the source code, clone the repository from Git:

Bash
深色版本
git clone [repository_url]
cd coaching-institute-management
Note: Replace [repository_url] with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. Create MySQL Database
Create a new database in MySQL using the following SQL commands:

Sql
深色版本
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE coaching_institute_db
    CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
    COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Use the created database
USE coaching_institute_db;
Make sure to use utf8mb4 character set to support multilingual characters including emojis.

3. Build and Run Backend Application
Navigate to the project root directory and build the application using Maven.

Clean and package the project (skip tests):
Bash
深色版本
mvn clean package -DskipTests
Build with tests (recommended for development environment):
Bash
深色版本
mvn clean verify
Start the Spring Boot Application:
Bash
深色版本
java -jar target/coaching-institute-management-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Or run the main class directly from your IDE.

4. Frontend Environment Setup
System Requirements:
Node.js: Latest or LTS version recommended. It includes npm (Node Package Manager) for managing frontend dependencies.
Code Editor: Such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, etc., which offer rich plugin support to improve development efficiency.
Version Control System: Git, used for code management and team collaboration.
Create CSS, JSON, JS files to connect with backend
In your frontend project, create the following types of files to communicate with the backend API:

CSS files – for styling.
JSON files – for configuration or static data.
JS/TS files – for calling backend REST APIs (e.g., using Axios or Fetch API).
Example JavaScript code to call backend API:

Javascript
深色版本
fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/students')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
5. Initialize Data
Once the application has started successfully, open your browser and visit:

深色版本
http://localhost:8080
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup. You can adjust the URL based on your deployment address (e.g., replace localhost with an IP or domain if deployed on a server).
